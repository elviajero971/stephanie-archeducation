      title: "About me"
      text_1: "Architect based in France with 8+ years of professional experience in design and build projects."
      text_2: "Co-founder of U/Lab : urban laboratory for emerging practices in architecture."
      text_3: "From leading the U/Lab initiative where I helped build community based installations with students in underprivileged neighborhoods, to collaborating with the renowned architect Carin Smuts building a community kitchen in Cape Town, each endeavor has shaped my hands-on approach to architecture and education."
      text_4: "Teaching design & build is a natural extension of my professional practice. By guiding students through the challenges of translating ideas into built realities, I hope to inspire the next generation of architects to think critically, design responsibly, and build innovatively."

      title: "Teaching statement"
      subtitle: "Building beyond the blueprint\u00a0: A hands-on approach to Architectural education"
      intro_1: "At the heart of my career is a commitment to a socially responsible architecture and a hands-on education that leads to it."
      intro_2: "In my teaching, I prioritize an experimental mindset that embraces failure as a valuable part of learning. It’s about guiding students making designs come to life, teaching them to work collaboratively with stakeholders and community members, and developing entrepreneurial spirits. Each step of this journey helps them realize they are not just designing for people, but with them."
      intro_3: "The ultimate reward of a design/build culture within academia lies in the tangible results: achieving a built prototype fosters pride and confidence. I am driven to cultivate this confidence in the next generation of architects, empowering them to take an active role in shaping the built environment and our future cities."
      title_1: "1. Taking the classroom outside"
      text_1_1: "A lasting and effective learning happens when the classroom extends into the real world. I believe in a “learn by doing” approach where students creatively adapt to unforeseen challenges. By combining theory and practical assignments, skill-sets to address larger societal issues are acquired: tackling climate change through building with recycled materials, adopting a reverse-design approach based on available resources, or exploring resilience and consumption by building community gardens. We also develop policies around the housing crisis by rehabilitating unfit apartments and building shelters for the homeless."
      title_2: "2. The importance of visuals and storytelling"
      text_2_1: "Inspiration from diverse disciplines and representation techniques teaches students that communication is key. Through case studies and selected examples, they learn to leverage their drawing skills in new ways, understanding how strong visuals engage communities. Semester assignments provide a guided experimenting ground: students use storytelling, innovative mapping, timelines and accessible plans to creatively transform concepts into reality."
      title_3: "3. A strong emphasis on cooperation"

      title_4: "4. Understanding & analyzing social roles"
      text_4_1: "A successful design & build project often begins with identifying key community members and stakeholders who can contribute meaningfully throughout the project’s life-cycle. By evaluating the potential and interests of each participant, students create visual diagrams to analyze and map this social network. This process becomes a powerful tool for building strong partnerships and fostering collaboration, preparing students for real-world situations. Beyond architectural design, they develop essential skills in navigating politics and business, preparing them to engage effectively with future clients and address community needs in their designs."
      title_5: "5. Fostering a technical culture"
      text_5_1: "A core tenet of my teaching is the maker culture and preparing students to approach construction not as a separate phase but as an integral part of the design process. They learn to study materials and their performance, working in a phased approach in order to gain confidence as designers : from small-scale prototypes to on site 1:1 scale. It’s not just about learning to swing a hammer, it’s about learning the practical implications of a drawing and infusing an increased sense of responsibility. Furthermore, I see the studio as a learning experience in how to work with “time & money” : we tackle technical issues like the true cost of things, security and procurement, unexpected events and tight deadlines. Partnerships with industry professionals would also complement the project management skills through the process."
      title_6: "6. The value of feedback"
      text_6_1: "Documenting the process with regular feedback is pivotal in experimental practices, it perpetuates a learning culture and strong resilience among students. I encourage students to learn from failures and see them as a step towards growth. I emphasize an approach of “what didn’t work” in feedback sessions, considering it as an assessment of how much the pedagogical goal has been met. One main focus of my educational approach is also the use of mixed media like videos and timelines, allowing different dimensions of a built project to emerge during reviews, and building with “time” in mind."
      conclusion_1: "My role as an educator is to guide students to take ownership of their projects and embrace challenges, emphasizing the process as much as the outcome in the learning agenda. Furthermore, engaging in hands-on experiences translates into impactful lessons and essential skills for navigating the complexities of professional practice."
      conclusion_2: "Through my experiences, I’ve learned that the act of building is not just about creating structures, it’s about forging connections. It is a shared journey that enriches both students as future professionals and the communities they serve."
      conclusion_3: "My belief in students’ immense potential drives my passion for teaching. University years are a unique opportunity to push limits, discover new passions, and evolve. I was fortunate to be guided by great mentors who shaped the architect and educator I’ve become, and I am committed to creating that same framework for emerging architects. In an evolving profession shaped by new technologies and economic realities, I aim to contribute to a pedagogy that explores the infinite possibilities of what it means to be an architect today."
